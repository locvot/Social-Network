# Social Network

This project implements the core backend functionalities of a **social network** inspired by Twitter. Built using modern web technologies, it provides RESTful APIs for key social features such as user authentication, tweet creation and retrieval, user interactions (following, commenting, liking), real-time chat, and media handling.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For server-side logic and API routing.
- **MongoDB**: A flexible, scalable NoSQL database for efficient data storage.
- **AWS S3**: For secure and efficient media storage (images, videos).
- **Socket.io**: For real-time communication and chat functionality.
- **JWT & Google OAuth 2.0**: For user authentication.

## ðŸ”§ Features

### User Authentication:
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure login and registration with JWT tokens.
